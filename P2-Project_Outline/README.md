## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here:

My project will be called crudNotes. It is flashcard sharing platform for students to support one another's studies. 
Lets say a student took business logistics 4500 at Ohio State University, and throughout the course they made a ton of flash cards for their studies.
That student could enter in their flash cards for other students to see. It would then be searchable by school, and then by class, and then even by chapter for which each flash card may have been for.

A nationwide list of universities will be available to choose from on the site. 
Due to the rapid nature of class name changes, student will have to enter in their own class names for their flash cards, 
but a format of course name and level will be required.

### Features
user login: students will need to create a login in order to use the site. 

Search: users will be able to search by school, course, and chapter within the course.

create: users will be able to create posts for their flash card sharing.

delete: only site admins will be able to delete user posts. this is for moderation purposes.
